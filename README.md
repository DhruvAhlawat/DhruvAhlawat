Hello, 
I'm Dhruv Ahlawat, A Computer Science student from IIT Delhi, India, graduating in 2025.

I'm interested in all fields of Computer Science, but Machine Learning and theory of Algorithms particularly interest me.
I am also a developer and I use Unity and blender for game development and would be happy to find people to collaborate with, so 
feel free to contact me through my email. I also enjoy competitive programming, and have a repository for my CP codes.
